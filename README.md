## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a test automation engineer specializing in Java and TestNG to build reliable, maintainable test frameworks for functional and regression testing. This repository showcases how I design and implement scalable test suites with a strong focus on test structure, parallel execution, and seamless continuous integration (CI).

Test automation is critical for ensuring software quality in fast-paced development environments. By leveraging TestNG's powerful features and Javaâ€™s robust ecosystem, I create test solutions that support early bug detection, faster feedback loops, and high test coverage.

Test Suite Organization: Each project follows a modular structure that separates test logic, data, and configuration for better readability and maintainability. You'll find examples of grouping tests by functionality, tagging with annotations, and parameterizing test methods for reusability.

Parallel Execution: To reduce execution time and increase efficiency, this repository includes configurations for running tests concurrently using TestNGâ€™s built-in thread management. I also demonstrate best practices for managing thread safety and avoiding flaky tests during parallel runs.

Continuous Integration: Integration with CI tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions is a core part of this setup. Projects include build scripts, test reports, and configuration files to automate the execution of test suites on code commits or pull requests, ensuring consistency across environments.

This repository is ideal for QA engineers, SDETs, and developers looking to build robust automation pipelines. Each project comes with setup instructions, sample test cases, and comments to guide you through the implementation.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”whether you're building a regression suite or integrating testing into your CI/CD pipeline, I hope this repository serves as a helpful resource.
